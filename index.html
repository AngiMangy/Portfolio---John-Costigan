                    Hello! My name is John Costigan and this is my portfolio, <br> I am a CSET student at Thaddeus Stevens College of Technology,
                    with an interest in software development and environmental conservation. <br> Here you will find some of the projects I have worked on,
                    some information about the skills I have learned so far, and a little bit about myself.

                <h3>Quiz App</h3>
                <p>
                    My quiz app is a simple ten question multiple choice quiz with a variety of topics ranging from
                    Animal Facts to Sports. It keeps track of your score and gives you a final tally at the end. aswell as tracking
                    how many times you have taken the quiz. <br>

                <h3>Grocery List</h3>
                <p>
                    The Grocery List is a simple form in which watever the user inputs gets added to a list below the form.
                    It also has a simplistic sorting function to sort from "purchased", "unpurchased" and "all".
                    A majority of the focus for this project was to show my understanding of JS interacting with HTML. <br>

                <h3>Tic-Tac-Toe</h3>
                <p>
                    A simple game of Tic-Tac-Toe that two players can play against eachother. Keeps a running tally of wins and ties.
                    In the future I plan to add a single player mode where you can play against the computer. This project was also Focused on
                    JS interaction with HTML elements. <br>

                <h3>JavaScript</h3>
                <p>
                    JavaScript is the language in which I feel the most comfortable with as of making this portfolio.
                    All three of the projects above were made using JavaScript to handle the logic and interaction
                    with the HTML elements. I feel I have a decent understanding of the basics and some intermediate concepts (DOM manipulation,
                    functions, arrays, objects etc.) but still have a lot to learn when it comes to more advanced concepts and frameworks
                    of JavaScript.

                <h3>HTML/CSS</h3>
                <p>
                    Its the backbone of web development. It is what was used to make both this portfolio page aswell as
                    the web pages for all three of the above projects. At the moment i do believe it is the weakest of my
                    skillset especially when it comes to manipulation of CSS elements. I am comfortable with basic HTML structure and tags
                    as well as basic CSS styling but have yet to dive deeper into more complex layouts and designs.

                Computer Software Engineering Technology. I have had an interest with technology and computers Since I was 10
                with an equally strong interest in Nature and wildlife. My Main goal with CSET is to land myself in a place in which
                I can work on software that helps protect the environment and wildlife in some way.
